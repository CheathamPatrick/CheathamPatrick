Thrush 56 is my Design, Arts, Arrangement, Photo, Video, and Production company. I am Patrick Lee Cheatham, pensioned U.S. Air Force Captain, after early departure from uniformed operations due to fortification of much of our U.S. food and beverage offerings.

I develop apps for latter versions of Windows.

I produce music as Entropic Front (Patrick Lee Cheatham) is an early 21st century symphonic style electronic music project. Bracing staccato and marcato instrumental electronica songs are haphazardly drawn visually, and even off segments are tweaked to harness oddities, as much as possible. Tonal aspects contrast from the stale to the enjoyable, in living, and elicit a range of alternating dour and uplifting demeanors of sound, or blend the two counterpoised opposite casts concurrently. I host a monthly to quarterly podcast on music theory and impact.

I invest sometimes at photography stints, and submit my best photos to Adobe Stock agency.

I write on societal trends of alarm.
